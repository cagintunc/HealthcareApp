The healthcare industry is shifting rapidly with AI and machine learning driving demand for precision medicine and personalized care. Providers face pressure to reduce errors, optimize workflows, and improve outcomes, while startups challenge traditional methods. Complex medical data remains underutilized without efficient analysis tools. 
This application bridges the gap, offering actionable insights to enhance clinicians' decision-making. It augments, NOT replaces, doctors by providing predictions based on patientâ€™s data to improve accuracy and reduce false positives. Unlike generalized databases, it delivers specialized insights tailored to clinical needs.
